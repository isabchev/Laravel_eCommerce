# Laravel eCommerce Project

This project is a simple example showcasing my knowledge of PHP Laravel framework and React javascript framework. It's a basic e-shop with products, categories, shopping cart, and CMS pages. Laravel is used to create the admin area, aided by the Filament package, and frontend API endpoints.

With API endpoints, the frontend application is independent from the backend and can be developed using various technologies such as vanilla JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue, or even a mobile application. For this project, I have chosen React as the frontend application because it is one of the most popular frameworks at the moment.
